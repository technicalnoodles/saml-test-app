# Create the Lambda Function

After the Lambda page is open, we can create a new function.  Click on the **Create Function** button on the right side of the screen to start the creation process.

After the **Create function** has loaded, we want to fill in some fields.  We want this function to be authored from scratch using the ```Author from scratch``` option.  
The input field ```Function name``` should have a value of ```shutdownPort```.  You may another name if you would prefer, but this lab will use shutdownPort.
The dropdown for the ```Runtime``` should be set to ```Python 3.8```.  
The last option called ```Architecture``` (besides the advanced options) will need to be set to ```x86_64```.

After all these fields have been set, the function should look similar to the below image:

Finally, we can click on ***Create function*** on the bottom right of the page to create our Lambda function.
